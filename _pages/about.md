Gage Coprivnicar grew up in Idaho starting at the age of 3, when his father, in the Airforce was relocated to fly the C-130 Hercules. He went to college out of state for the first two years at Colorado School of Mines, pursing his degree in Electrical Engineering. After two years, Gage decided to take a few years off of school and pursued other interests such as woodworking and gardening. He went back to school in 2021 on the tail end of COVID-19 and finished his degree in Electrical Engineering in 2023 at Boise State, and is working on his Masters in the same field.

Gage Coprivnicar moved to Garden City in 2024, purchasing a house, and is interested in getting involved in the local community as much as possible. He is often found biking around the greenbelt and offering help to any other bikers who need help repairing their bike or inflating a flat tire.

He has a lot of leadership experience, having been a guide for local rafting non-profit for over a decade. He was the Vice-President of the BSU branch of IEEE (Institute for Electronic and Electrical Engineers), and is the Vice-Chair of his local HOA, working with his neighbors to solve any misunderstandings or clarify any HOA questions they may have.
