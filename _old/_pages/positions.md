## Greenbelt

I have been a bike commuter for over a year now and as a result I have a great idea of what sort of improvements would benefit the Garden City Community the most. The Garden City portion of the greenbelt has many wooden bridges, most if not all of which are slowly deteriorating, and being patched with metal plates. If I was elected to the City Council of Garden City, I'd advocate for these bridges to be updated to the concrete ones we see more frequently in the Boise and Eagle sections of Garden City.

## Improved Alternative Transportation Infrastructure.

As I don't own a car, I have found myself taking the bus on many occasions. When my bike is out of service, when the weather is bad, or just for a bit of fun! I love taking the bus, and the two primary routes in Garden City VRT #8 and #9 are good, reliable, and frequent enough. I would love to see an increased advocacy for Garden City locals to use the bus system to get to and from frequented locations like the Fairgrounds and the new park being built there, Boise Downtown, and many of the wonderful parks that the bus stops are adjacent to!

I'd also really like to see increased coordination with ACHD about consistent bike lanes and infrastructure on specifically State St. As Garden City grows, it will be important to allow folks the ability to get where they need to safely, quickly, and as little driving as possible!

## Garden City Garden Program
The Garden City Pollinator Garden is a wonderful spot to learn about native plants, animals, and insects. I'd love to see this expanded into a gardening program, where locals are encouraged and taught to learn and care for a small garden for themselves and others, and how to best use and preserve any vegetables grown. This could also be done in coordination with the Garden City Library to create a youth program encouraging kids to learn gardening, cooking, and preservation skills.

## Compost Program

I would love to see Garden City integrated into the existing Boise Composting program. So much food waste exists, and it would be wonderful to be able to use the compost dirt piles that Boise makes available to their residents, available to Garden City as well! This would work well with the Garden City Garden's Program and reduce potential costs as the compost generated could be used for Gardening, and food waste generated turned to compost!
